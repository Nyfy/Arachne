# Arachne Web Crawler
The goal of this project was to create a flexible, scalable and easily maintainable all-purpose Web Crawler while familiarizing
myself with core data mining concepts. The idea was to create a generic and configurable implementation, to allow it
to serve as an independant development base for projects prior to requiring an efficient and specialized Crawler implementation 
for production.

## Getting Started
TODO: Add instructions for running the crawler

## Configuring the crawler
